"The Synapse/S3 indices are the ones we used when processing TCGA, GTEx, and TARGET. 
The superset is the ALL version of the gencode annotation file. Much to my chagrin, I haven't been able to locate the precise commands I used to generate the index (unlike RSEM / STAR) in my notes â€” a definitive science faux pas
RC, I created a BED file from the GTF using gtf2bed, then created a transcriptome fasta for Kallisto using Bedtools getFasta. Back when I made the index, Kallisto had just come out and I think the index creation process was different and required both a GTF and a fasta, but I could be wrong."
